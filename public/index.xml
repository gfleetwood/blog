      <description>Introduction My favorite data visualization is Inequality And New York’s Subway. It provides a fascinating look into the city via its main circulatory system. The information is a bit dated now (the data is from 2011), and I’ve always wanted to update it. However, navigating the US Census Bureau’s data portal always ended with me closing the tab in frustration.
My luck changed when Safe Graph released free neighborhood census data from 2016.</description>

      <description>The changing face of journalism has been written about extensively, which is unsurprising given the field’s major occupation. Advertistng driven revenue reached a peak of close to $50 billion dollars in about 2010 before being suffocated by the Google and Facebook juggernauts. Cue the shuttering of newsrooms and clearing of desks as the industry struggled to regain its footing in the digital age. Even new media companies who thought they had the nimbleness to avoid the fate of the old guard have stumbled.</description>

Pass Prediction In Soccer
Links: [Blog] | [Code]
Description: Analysis of data for the Football Pass Prediction Challenge of the 5th Workshop on Machine Learning and Data Mining for Sports Analytics. It consisted of mostly of player location data for over 12,000 passes from Belgian soccer. The stated goal was to predict the recipient of a pass.
Summary: The main pipeline involved feature engineering to create a feature for distance, another for the product of x-y coordinates, scaling numeric features, and dummying the sole categorical column.</description>

      <description>After centuries of trying I finally mastered the art of blogdown. All it took was incremental version controlled changes and keeping git revert --hard close at hand. This is my third blog iteration after a Jekyll based version and Medium. They were both ill-equiped to handle Data Analysis heavy posts, so this setup is just right - especially after I figured out how to embed Jupyter notebooks in RMarkdown. For posteriority&amp;rsquo;s sake, here are links to Medium and RPubs.</description>
