      <description>Announcement I’m moving towards writing reference articles for problems I’ve solved instead of saving links. This is the first of these.
 Summary Setting up a Raspberry Pi can be frustrating if you’re not prepared. On the manual route of flashing an SD card and navigating the alpha soup of cable connectors (USB Mini, USB C, HDMI to Mini HDMI), the other potential sticking points are the input and output devices.</description>

      <description>Ideas on my “Someday” list usually spend a couple of weeks before leaving forever or returning in disgrace (mine not its). “Can I automatically create an audiobook?” had a successful turn around of about three days.
The book I choose was Carroll Quigley’s “The Evolution Of Civilizations”. I’m at a point where I am militantly electronic with my reading, so the pdf link from Twitter was perfect. Skimming the book I got the sense that I’d prefer to listen rather than read it - a bifurcation that I recently adopted after ignoring audiobooks for years.</description>

      <title>Google Drive As A Blogdown CMS</title>

      <description>The true catalyst for this work is lost to the annals of time (known as September 2019), but bits and pieces surface from time to time. They include musings on the Jamstack, GitHub as a personal data store, concatenating different services, and, perhaps most importantly, how to combine these with a multi-user blogging site based on blogdown. Actually, I’m missing another important cause in the wish to have a traditional Content Management System to acccomodate those who aren’t familiar with markdown.</description>

      <description>The changing face of journalism has been written about extensively, which is unsurprising given the field’s major occupation. Advertistng driven revenue reached a peak of close to $50 billion dollars in about 2010 before being suffocated by the Google and Facebook juggernauts. Cue the shuttering of newsrooms and clearing of desks as the industry struggled to regain its footing in the digital age. Even new media companies who thought they had the nimbleness to avoid the fate of the old guard have stumbled.</description>

      <description>After centuries of trying I finally mastered the art of blogdown. All it took was incremental version controlled changes and keeping git revert --hard close at hand. This is my third blog iteration after a Jekyll based version and Medium. They were both ill-equiped to handle Data Analysis heavy posts, so this setup is just right - especially after I figured out how to embed Jupyter notebooks in RMarkdown. For posteriority&amp;rsquo;s sake, here are links to Medium and RPubs.</description>
