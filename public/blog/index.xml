      <description>Introduction My favorite data visualization is Inequality And New York’s Subway. It provides a fascinating look into the city via its main circulatory system. The information is a bit dated now (the data is from 2011), and I’ve always wanted to update it.

      <description>After centuries of trying I finally mastered the art of blogdown. All it took was incremental version controlled changes and keeping git revert --hard close at hand. This is my third blog iteration after a Jekyll based version and Medium.
