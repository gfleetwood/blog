<p>Usually I consume GitHub notifications at my leisure, but a month ago I had to shake a leg for a collaboration. I wasn’t shaking it fast enough since my main method for finding out notifications is via my email.</p>
<p>I needed real time notifications without having to develop a new habit. Since GitHub doesn’t provide that option I had to roll my own. It turned out to be pretty simple with a single script connecting GitHub and Twilio with scheduled based profiling provided by deploying on Heroku. Every two hours it checks GitHub for unread notifications, and sends me a text with the name of the repository. It was so easy I only decided to do a write up now, about two months later.</p>
<p>Here’s a link to the <a href="https://github.com/gfleetwood/github-sms-notifications">code</a>. The README has the replication details.</p>
