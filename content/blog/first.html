<p>After centuries of trying I finally mastered the art of blogdown. All it took was incremental version controlled changes and keeping <code>git revert --hard</code> close at hand. This is my third blog iteration after a Jekyll based version and Medium. They were both ill-equiped to handle Data Analysis heavy posts, so this setup is just right - especially after I figured out how to embed Jupyter notebooks in RMarkdown. For posteriorityâ€™s sake, here are links to <a href="https://medium.com/@gorafle">Medium</a> and <a href="https://rpubs.com/gfleetwood">RPubs</a>.</p>
<p>Later.</p>
