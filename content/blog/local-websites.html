<p>This is a reference blog on how to build a local DNS.</p>
<p>I use Google Chrome as my main browser, but I’ve been thinking of switching (or at least trying out) others. This possibility is hampered by Chrome lock-in powered by extensions and bookmarks, with the latter being the main issue.</p>
<p>The initial step involved a browser agnostic bookmark manager. I settled on buku which is cli based with an additional buku server to allow administration through a web interface. The next step was to permanently run buku server on a local port. Easy enough with systemd. Instead of bookmarking or typing 127.0.0.8000 (for example), I wanted to be able to type buku.me instead. That turned out to be much harder.</p>
<p>All these instructions pertain to Ubuntu 20.04.</p>
<div id="step-1" class="section level2">
<h2>Step 1</h2>
<p>Install buku And buku server: <code>pip3 install buku[server]</code>.</p>
</div>
<div id="step-2" class="section level2">
<h2>Step 2</h2>
<p>Permanently run buku server with system d.</p>
<p>Add this script as an executable to your bin folder. (Mine is called buku_server.) You’ll have to find out where buku server is installed with <code>which bukuserver</code>.</p>
<pre><code># I&#39;m using port 5555 but choose whichever port you want
/home/gordon/miniconda3/bin/bukuserver run --host 127.0.0.1 --port 5555
</code></pre>
<p>Next add this service file, <code>buku_server.service</code>, to <code>/etc/systemd/system</code>.</p>
<pre><code>[Unit]
Description=Buku Server

[Service]
User=gordon
WorkingDirectory=/home/gordon/.local/mybin
ExecStart=/bin/bash /home/gordon/.local/mybin/buku_server
Restart=always

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target</code></pre>
<p>Start and enable the service.</p>
<pre><code>systemctl start buku_server.service
systemctl enable buku_server.service</code></pre>
<p>Go to <code>127.0.0.1:5555</code> to check that buku server is running.</p>
</div>
<div id="step-3" class="section level2">
<h2>Step 3</h2>
<p>This was the draw the rest of the owl part for me. I finally understood the process due to this blog:</p>
<p><code>https://www.interserver.net/tips/kb/local-domain-names-ubuntu/</code></p>
<p>First you need to add a line to your <code>/etc/hosts</code> file: <code>127.0.0.1 buku.me</code>. Then add this to a configuration file in <code>/etc/apache2/sites-available</code> (mine is <code>000-default.conf</code>):</p>
<pre><code># ServerName, ProxyPass, and ProxyPasReverse are the entries to change

&lt;VirtualHost *:80&gt;
  ServerAdmin test@test.com
  ServerName buku.me
  ProxyPass / http://127.0.0.1:5555/
  ProxyPassReverse / http://127.0.0.1:5555/
&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;</code></pre>
<p>With that I was able to go to buku.me in my browser to access the buku server.</p>
</div>
<div id="bonus" class="section level2">
<h2>Bonus</h2>
<p>Even with this setup I still had to manually add urls to buku server. I wanted to have a shortcut, CTRL+B, that would automatically add a url. This solution actually adds whatever is on the clipboard to buku, so it’s on me to make sure it’s a url.</p>
<p>In Ubuntu I mapped this custom shortcut to CTRL+B: <code>/home/gordon/miniconda3/bin/python /home/gordon/buku_add.py</code> where buku_add.py is:</p>
<pre><code>import pyperclip
import os

os.system(&quot;buku -a {}&quot;.format(pyperclip.paste()))</code></pre>
<p>buku_add.py is a vanilla Python script instead of an executable because that didn’t work. I have no idea why.</p>
