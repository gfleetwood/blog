```{r setup, include=FALSE}

After centuries of trying I finally mastered the art of blogdown. All it took was incremental version controlled changes and keeping `git revert --hard` close at hand. This is my third blog iteration after a Jekyll based version and Medium. They were both ill-equiped to handle Data Analysis heavy posts, so this setup is just right - especially after I figured out how to embed Jupyter notebooks in RMarkdown. For posteriority's sake, here are links to [Medium](https://medium.com/@gorafle) and [RPubs](https://rpubs.com/gfleetwood).

Later.
